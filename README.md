# Am-I-Shakespeare
A RNN Model to predict text of poems.

A Recurrent Neural Network made using the LSTM(Long short-term memory) layer to predict the prose of Shakespeare litrature.

The model takes a shakespeare literature text and then tries to predict the next lines of the literature.

Project made during my start of learning in Natural Language Processing.
